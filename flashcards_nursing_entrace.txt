Full name for ATP (cellular energy source)
Cellular respiration 
Creating ATP from food, typically glucose
ATP mechanisms
Glycolysis, Krebs cycle and electron transport chain
Glycolysis 
Anaerobic metabolic pathway that gets ATP from glucose
Metabolic pathway 
Linked biochemical reactions for common purpose
Fermentation 
Anaerobic process to regenerate NAD+ from NADH
Aerobic respiration
Continue glycolysis aerobically (in mitochondria) with Krebs Cycle and electron transport
Autotroph
Self-feeding organisms such as plants
Photosynthesis
Using energy from the sun to make glucose
Chloroplast 
Organelle in plant cells that does photosynthesis

Green tissue in plants that does photosynthesis 
Stomata
Pores in leads to allow CO2 and Oxygen interchange
Stroma 
Fluid in inner membrane of chloroplast
Genes
Encoding of physical traits
Transcription 
Create complementary gene sequence (of DNA) in RNA
Translation
Create protein from RNA
Nucleotides
Building block of DNA - adenine, guanine, thymine, cytosine 
Nucleotide pairs
Adenine with thymine, cytosine with guanine 
DNA
Double stranded polymer built from nucleotides
Central dogma
DNA for physical traits, replicated from existing DNA, transcribed to RNA, which is translated to protein 
Genetic code
Sequence of codons (three nucleotides) in DNA/RNA that encode amino acids or stop signals
mutation
When nucleotides are added, deleted, or changed
RNA
Single stranded nucleic acid with ribose backbone instead of deoxyribose 
RNA types
Messenger RNA, ribosomal RNA, transfer RNA
Cell theory
All living things made of cells, which are primary unit, and arise from existing cells
Prokaryote 
Simple Unicellular organism with no membrane bound organelles
Prokaryote examples
Archaebacteria and eubacteria
Prokaryote features
No nucleus, single circular DNA in nucleoid region and conduct respiration in cell membrane
Archaebacteria 
Prokaryotes that typically live in extreme environments without oxygen 
Eukaryotic cells
Cells with organelles used by protists, yeasts, algae and multicellular life 
Plasma membrane
Selectively permeable cell membrane
Organelles 
Membrane-bound structures in cells that carry out specific functions, like nucleus and mitochondria 
Nucleus
Large organelle that stores DNA
Neucleolus
Dense structure in nucleus that makes rRNA synthesis occurs 
Histones 
Protein that packages DNA and regulates access to genes
Chromatin
DNA packaged with histones
Ribosomes 
Site of protein construction (RNA translation). Not an organelle.
Ribosome structure 
Two subunits, one large, one small
Endoplasmic reticulum
Network of membrane-enclosed tubules/sacs connected to nucleus. Rough and Smooth types.
Rough v smooth endoplasmic reticulum
Whether ribosomes line outer surface. Rough for protein synthesis, smooth for lipid synthesis and detox 
bound ribosomes
Bound ribosomes make proteins secreted from cell or for organelles or cell membrane
free ribosomes
free ribosomes make proteins for use cell's cytoplasm
Cisernea
Interior of rough endoplasmic reticulum 
Golgi apparatus
Stack of membrane-enclosed sacs that receive membrane-bound vesicles and modify, repackage, and ship proteins
Lysosomes

Microbodies
Specialized organelle for containing metabolic reactions
Peroxisome 
Microbody that breaks down fats, also detoxifying compounds like alcohol
Glyoxysomes
Microbody that convert fats to sugars for plants too young for photosynthesis 
Vacuoles
Membrane-enclosed sacs, typically non-animals with functions for pressure, ph and more.
